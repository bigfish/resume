<p>With over a decade of experience making websites and web applications, I&#39;m passionate
about creating high quality user experiences with performant, tested, and scalable code.
I&#39;m most experienced with enterprise single page applications connected to REST APIs.
I thrive on creating user interfaces that look good and work well. For fun I make games,
mobile web apps, and explore emerging technologies.</p>
