<p>With many years of experience making websites and web applications, I&#39;m passionate
about creating high quality user experiences with performant, tested, and scalable code.
I&#39;m most experienced with single page applications connected to REST APIs.
I thrive on creating user interfaces that look good and work well. I enjoy learning and 
trying out emerging web technologies, in order to stay up to date and use them where appropriate.</p>
