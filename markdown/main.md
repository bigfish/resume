With many years of experience making websites and web applications, I'm passionate
about creating high quality user experiences with performant, tested, and scalable code.
I'm most experienced with single page applications connected to REST APIs.
I thrive on creating user interfaces that look good and work well. I enjoy learning and 
trying out emerging web technologies, in order to stay up to date and use them where appropriate.
