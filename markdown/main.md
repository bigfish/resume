With over a decade of experience making websites and web applications, I'm passionate
about creating high quality user experiences with performant, tested, and scalable code.
I'm most experienced with enterprise single page applications connected to REST APIs.
I thrive on creating user interfaces that look good and work well. For fun I make games,
mobile web apps, and explore emerging technologies.
